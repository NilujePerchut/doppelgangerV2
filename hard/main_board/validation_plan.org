* ARM microprocessor
** Bootloader
- [X] Porting from github
- [X] Flash a simple UF2 application
- [X] Implements the config sector in both bootloader and applcation
- [X] Implements a patcher for user space config
** Buttons
- [X] Up button
- [X] Reset button
** Progammation
- [X] DFU Bootloader
- [X] BOOT0 via push button
** HSE Oscillator
- [X] Startup time (>>1ms. is this a problem ?)
- [X] Frequency (8MHz)
- [X] CPU at 168MHz

** Serial link with PIC microprocessor
- [X] Tx
- [X] Rx

** Misc
- [X] 5V / 3.3V marker
  - [X] from 5V (2.31V read)
  - [X] from 3.3V (1.52V read)
- [X] GPIOs from mux

* PIC microprocessor
